I am a Ph.D candidate at [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/) in the [Semantics, Cybersecurity, and Services (SCS) group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/scs/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Thijs van Ede](https://thijsvane.de/) and [Dr. Andrea Continella](https://conand.me/).

My research interest lies in AI-driven threat analysis in incident response.

Before joining the University of Twente, I completed my Masters in Computer Science with Cybersecurity specilization at [Eötvös Loránd University](https://www.elte.hu/en/).
