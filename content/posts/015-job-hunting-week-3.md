title: "Job Hunting: Week 3: No one is even interested in taking an interview. Wow. But I will make something of my own and they will see."

description: "I will be creating a newsletter where the main focus will be cybersecurity news (of course). The catch is... there will also be a tutorial related to a skill/tool/technology. The aim is that the newletter is relevant to a broader category of people including both technical and non-technical audience."

## I will start the newsletter this week. I am still applying for jobs but it's so hard to get interviews haha. Still at it.

# 08 July - Monday

- I have chosen the theme for the newsletter and I used Canva for this! They have a lot of templates.
- I think it is better to give headlines or the title of the news rather than writing about one piece.
- It will also allow me to gather more news in one place.
- More things to come...

# 09 July - Tuesday

- I have to build a VM environment for learning Windows Server and another environment for Malware analysis.
- Closed in more on the template to use for the newsletter. It's basic-simple and is dark-theme.
- Have to write fresh content for Dezible. Maybe I should document my journey and share it on LinkedIn as well.


# 10 July - Wednesday

- I was able to install Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 Enterprise on VirtualBox successfully.
- Made the header for the newsletter. Now will test by adding some text.
- But there is a lot of personal work left at the moment - Administration stuff for Visa. Phew.
- Started maintaining a spreadsheet for my daily work and keeping track of resources I use.
- Better to follow the course on malware analysis by TCM - can move to advanced course after that.
- Will focus on Malware, Breaches and Vulnerabilities in the newsletter - with reports/findings at the side.
- Should also start CTFs - I found a good site

# 11 July - Thursday

- I would call it a productive day. I was able to get my personal shit done.
- There are a couple more things to take care of.

# 12 July - Friday

- Looks like I am nearly done with the documentation required for the Visa thingy.
- But it was very hot and I didn't feel like doing anything.
- A little sad because, though I have things-to-do already planned, takes more than just time to get on them and finish them.
- Should not aim for perfection. Should start writing right away.


...
It will be a better week ahead for sure.
