description: "I will be creating a newsletter where the main focus will be cybersecurity news (of course). The catch is... there will also be a tutorial related to a skill/tool/technology. The aim is that the newletter is relevant to a broader category of people including both technical and non-technical audience."

## I will start the newsletter this week. I am still applying for jobs but it's so hard to get interviews haha. Still at it.

# 08 July - Monday

- I have chosen the theme for the newsletter and I used Canva for this! They have a lot of templates.
- I think it is better to give headlines or the title of the news rather than writing about one piece.
- It will also allow me to gather more news in one place.
- More things to come...

# 09 July - Tuesday


# 10 July - Wednesday


# 11 July - Thursday


# 12 July - Friday
