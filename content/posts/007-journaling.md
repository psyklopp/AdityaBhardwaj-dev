I am more focused on my thesis than ever. So it is very common to lose the train of thought and spiral down into side-quests (which are not important at the moment)

## Writing helps

Because my brain is just working and thinking about so many things at the same time, writing them down narrows the big tunnel of thoughts. It's almost like meditating, but actively choosing to think about one topic at particular at a time. Also brings down the anxiety and maybe helps with building some discipline.

## Wrapping it up

**Have a lot of writing to do for thesis!**
