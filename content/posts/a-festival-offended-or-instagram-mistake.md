description: "I recently attended 'SANTSAT', a music festival. Although it was really fun because I was present with my friends, I didn't really like the music which they played. I posted about it as an Instagram story saying that I will make mixes titled 'SANTSAT_KILLER'. The story disappeared after 6 hours maybe. I reported this to Instagram and asked about the same. Yes, SANTSAT saw the story. I am waiting."
