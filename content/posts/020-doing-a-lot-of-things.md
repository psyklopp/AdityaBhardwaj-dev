## PhD
---

I have been applying to some PhD programes recently. A fair amount of research needs to be put in:

1. Narrowing down your research interest.
2. Searching for relevant PhD vacancies.
3. Applying with tailor-made cover letters and CV.

Honestly, I like putting in the work. Because it's fun and engaging.

It is the only time when someone actually reads your stuff (hopefully). Hence, I am even more motivated to craft applications with care.

But I also want to work on side-projects to build something. For the community and myself.

## Time allocation works in theory but what about achieving a certain goal instead?

I tend to over-indulge in problems.

And then I find myself spending hours reading and figuring out solutions. Yes, most of them are tech/code related.

Instead of allocating and blocking hours, I could be allocating **a part of the day** instead.

If I am done with my important and urgent tasks early in the day (anytime during the day), I can work on other thingies.

But this doesn't happen. 

I glue myself to such tasks the whole day... until I feel I have done a *major* part of it, or even better, everything.

## Focus

I love studying hence finding a PhD. program is on top of my list.

Maybe I can set a deadline during the day, after which I can work on my personal-side-projects **only**.

> Sounds easy right? Common sense.

But it's fairly hard.

I will try to do it. And report back. Take care.
