Now that the date is getting closer I feel more anxious. But I have been trying to keep it in under check.

## Going outside, like to a cafe

It gets a little harder when you have to sit down, in your room and focus on your work. I am not sure what's the exact reason but I guess it's more comfortable at home and you have a lot of stuff that you can get distracted by. Hence, I will be going outside to work and gradually increase the hours. I hope it works.

## Wrapping it up

**Have a lot of writing to do for thesis! Hoping everything works out**
