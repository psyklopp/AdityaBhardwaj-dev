## Presentations, reading reports and preparing documents is something that I have always found interesting.

I believe that cybersecurity is too technical sometimes.

Of course it is technical. But sometimes, all I need is a brief overview of a problem/solution in cybersecurity. There is a lot of academic research that goes on in the background. And it is not VERY common for people to go over such research regularly. And there is a lot of published data and reports that covers new technologies.

Only problem, it is hard to digest such information. And even harder to make it presentable for non-technical audience.

## Dezible.

That's what I want to do with Dezible. I want to go over academic reports and make presentations on them.

I will publish it on LinkedIn as that's where my target community lies.

I will keep doing it. And I will stick to it.
