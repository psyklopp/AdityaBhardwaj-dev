description: "Last week I said I will be starting a newsletter but there is already a lot of companies and people who are doing that. So I need a way to market it differently. Earlier I was thinking about including a nice tutorial but I came across some CTFs and I really want to do participate and learn the art of doing challenges in such events. So maybe I can add writeups with the newsletter."

## This week is a little different as I will be outside Budapest for the majority of the week.

I was outside Budapest and came back today (Friday 19 July). I am still in the process of applying for a job-seeking visa. There was one important document for which I had to return early but eventually I was able to vist the office to get the same!

CTFs is something I had never tried before but they are very interesting and I want to continue doing it.

I am applying to various jobs and no one wants to give a chance, even for just an interview or a preliminary discussion. It's also time to redo my CV perhaps?

Currently I am also working on developing a Wordpress website. I have some experience with using Wordpress and this allows me to earn some much-needed-cash.

...
I am still hopeful to find a suitable job where I can learn more.
