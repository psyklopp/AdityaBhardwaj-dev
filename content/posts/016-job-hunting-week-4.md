description: "Last week I said I will be starting a newsletter but there is already a lot of companies and people who are doing that. So I need a way to market it differently. Earlier I was thinking about including a nice tutorial but I came across some CTFs and I really want to do participate and learn the art of doing challenges in such events. So maybe I can add writeups with the newsletter."
