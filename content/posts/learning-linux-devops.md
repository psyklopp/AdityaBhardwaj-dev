description: "There has been sometime since I kept my focus and learned a new technical skill. I was busy keeping up with the studies last semester and learning to mix on my DJ this month. I came across this Linux Administration/DevOps course, and registered for it. I had to complete some preliminary quizzes and will write about it"

I also recently applied for a **Product Support Intern** position in Ericsson recently. It didn't ask for a lot of technical skills but it surely mentions that a good understanding of Linux, IP, Cloud technologies or Python is an `advantage`. Of course it is.

Keeping up and polishing the basics is the most important aspect of being a developer. The time when I was working in India as a Java developer, my manager often emphasized how crucial it is to be *VERY* good with the basics of the technology you are working on/with. Senior developers tend to get their skills rusty in this department... because they have other stuff to attend to.

Therefore I am gonna work on my basics now. Although I am studying cybersecurity, I want to get comfortable with Linux first.

I came across this page: [Linux Administration/DevOps Course](https://nixstech.com/education/linux-administration-devops-course/) on Facebook. (It was a sponsored post) Probably the only time I clicked on an actual ad.

Never the less, I registered for it and received an email with links to a portal. I had to do some quizzes. It was actually a really nice experience and the questions were not witless or dull like I have experienced before. I will share about this later and update this post.

> more coming soon
