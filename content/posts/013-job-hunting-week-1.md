This is the week where I have my thesis defense. And then I can finally say that I completed my Master's degree!

# 24 June - Monday

- I just finished writing notes for OSI Model and will share them soon in my website [Dezible](https://www.dezible.com).
- I think this was the first time when I actually liked learning (and not just cramming) about OSI layer.

# 25 June - Tuesday

- It was a fun night as my friend was leaving back to India.
- Completing my thesis presentation and hoping to do it without too much stress!

# 26 June - Wednesday

- I am not applying to jobs at the moment. Want to do the thesis defense with some preparation!
- Pretty sure that I got the flow of my presentation sorted out.
- Still thinking about the career choice.
