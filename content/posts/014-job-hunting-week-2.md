description: "I have always wanted to build something. Being a computer science student, I learned a lot about development practices but never got closer to finishing a project. Just like a lot of people I guess. I am deeply interested in owning something REAL along with being relevant in the cybersecurity space. I think it's time to make something finally."

I had my thesis defense on 28 June, Friday and I am happy to announce it was successful! 

# 01 July - Monday

- I will make a simple app containing cybersecurity news.
- Yet to decide on the design scheme but have a general idea.
- If I take a course from Udemy, should be enough to get me started towards what I want.
- Should have no ads, no data collection, signup on a single website using QR code.
- Simple design, easy to read single page, minimum obstruction to reading.
- Advertisers can sponsor if the text is relevant.
- Option to change text size.

# 02 July - Tuesday

- Made a small list of resources like websites and blogs where I can see news.
- Will be using RSS reader to fetch latest posts.
- Created Google alerts for keywords related to cybersecurity.
- Need to start learning development in Flutter.
- And also plan to do some courses on the 'LinkedIn Learning' platform.

I have a good collection of resources to start at the moment. Maybe I can start posting content on LinkedIn. Need to create a habit of creating content.

# 03 July - Wednesday

- I have started the course [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/)
- I had started this course even before but that was the time when I was busy with the admission process as well.
- This time, I will finish it for sure.

# 04 July - Thursday

- I was able to run the test application for Flutter with Visual Studio as the IDE.
- It was also important to apply some settings for the editor UI and it was successful (though it took some time)
- Now I can continue following the course
- Made a long list of things I have to do - maybe I should write more, everyday.
- Make use of LinkedIn Learning.

# 05 July - Friday

- A really productive day.
- Figured out my short term goal and a way to align it with my long-term goal.
- More coming soon ...

## Long-term goals

- [ ] Create a web app. Invite only
- [ ] People can choose their favorite story. Win a chance to get vouchers in cybersecurity.
- [ ] Keep low barriers to trying your app.
- [ ] Gamifying can help.

This way I will make something for real. And will keep learning about cybersecurity too. Let's go.

Let's make something useful for people.
