draft: false
description: "I have always wanted to build something. Being a computer science student, I learned a lot about development practices but never got closer to finishing a project. Just like a lot of people I guess. I am deeply interested in owning something REAL along with being relevant in the cybersecurity space. I think it's time to make something finally."

I had my thesis defense on 28 June, Friday and I am happy to announce it was successful! 

# 01 July - Monday

- I will make a simple app containing cybersecurity news.
- Yet to decide on the design scheme but have a general idea.
- If I take a course from Udemy, should be enough to get me started towards what I want.
- Should have no ads, no data collection, signup on a single website using QR code.
- Simple design, easy to read single page, minimum obstruction to reading.
- Advertisers can sponsor if the text is relevant.
- Option to change text size.

# 02 July - Tuesday

- Made a small list of resources like websites and blogs where I can see news.
- Will be using RSS reader to fetch latest posts.
- Created Google alerts for keywords related to cybersecurity.
- Need to start learning development in Flutter.
- And also plan to do some courses on the 'LinkedIn Learning' platform.

I have a good collection of resources to start at the moment. Maybe I can start posting content on LinkedIn. Need to create a habit of creating content.

## Long-term goals

- [ ] Create a web app. Invite only
- [ ] People can choose their favorite story. Win a chance to get vouchers in cybersecurity.
- [ ] Keep low barriers to trying your app.
- [ ] Gamifying can help.

This way I will make something for real. And will keep learning about cybersecurity too. Let's go.

Let's make something useful for people.
