description: "I have always wanted to build something. Being a computer science student, I learned a lot about development practices but never got closer to finishing a project. Just like a lot of people I guess. I am deeply interested in owning something REAL along with being relevant in the cybersecurity space. I think it's time to make something finally."

I had my thesis defense on 28 June, Friday and I am happy to announce it was successful! 

# 01 July - Monday

- I will make a simple app containing cybersecurity news.
- Yet to decide on the design scheme but have a general idea.
- If I take a course from Udemy, should be enough to get me started towards what I want.
- Should have no ads, no data collection, signup on a single website using QR code.
- Simple design, easy to read single page, minimum obstruction to reading.
- Advertisers can sponsor if the text is relevant.
- Option to change text size.

This way I will make something for real. And will keep learning about cybersecurity too. Let's go.

Let's make something useful for people.
