It is 7:44 P.M. at the time of writing.

I had a long day working on the presentation for my thesis. I added content on Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Shortest Integer Solution (SIS) which are important concepts in lattice-based cryptography. Though I am sure I added the important parts I will also refer to these [notes](https://simons.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/docs/14967/sis.pdf) for a better understanding.

The next thing to do is to add the [ROS attack](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/945.pdf).
