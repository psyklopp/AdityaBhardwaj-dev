Just wanted to come here and share that I have been quite busy these days. First, I am still waiting for Ericsson and SAP to respond to the internship application :/ I have also been trying to keep up with the college work. I chose "Comparative study of post-quantum key-exchange mechanisms and its implementations" for one of my labs. It will require me to make a report and a presentation on my findings.

Look like there is a lot of post-quantum for me in this semester. I have decided to do my thesis work... also based on lattice-based blind signatures, to be used in e-cash mechanism. It is interesting and I hope I will be able to do my best.

It will be a little hard but I guess, we just move through and keep up with the courseware. I will try to share some notes on the subjects I have on that particular day. Will help in accountability.

## What about learning Linux/DevOps
Oooh. I did install Elementary OS which is a beautiful Linux distribution. And now that I think about it, I will start using a little bit more. Windows is of course, so comfortable to use and honestly, there has been some time since I shut it down and let it rest.

Phew.

Python is something I will be using a lot. So yep, it's definitely a good idea to start using Linux.

## Wrapping it up

*   Keep track of subjects
*   Plan the work for lab-course
*   Start using Elementary OS
*   One day at a time.
