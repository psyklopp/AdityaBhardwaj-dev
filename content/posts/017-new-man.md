## Although I try to be optimistic mostly. The past few days gave me a hard reality check and most importantly, made me realize how people are the most important part of your life.

In my last post, I had shared that I was in the process of applying for the job-seeking visa. It turned out that the rules now are EXTREMELY strict regarding the timeline of application.

The staff in one of the office branches straight-up refused to accept my application. Even though I was late, I should have got the chance to submit it. I was not even given any document specifying the reason for turning me away.

Alternative? Find a job in a week.

Which was possible. But only mathematically.

I was distraught, not because I had go back to India but at the fact that after spending 3 years studying for a Master's degree, you are not given the chance to stay and use it.

It was on the last day when I was saved by a very helpful person. I went to a different branch of the immigration office and the guy attending my case, understood my situation immediately.

To say that he was helpful, would be an under-statement. He made calls to his supervisor including other officials to gather facts about my case. Honestly, I had no expectation but the official tried his best and accepted my application in the end.

Though this doesn't mean that I am granted the relevant visa, I just wanted a fair chance and I got it.

## Very bad shoulder pain.

I am pretty sure that it is due to my bad sleeping posture and the use of fan.

I went to have a massage and now I wonder why didn't I try it earlier. The lady was very sweet and I think she saw the relief I had, on my face.

'You a new man', she said. I was, indeed.

Will definitely go again.

## Next?

Will prepare for what is coming next.

And now I know that I should be appreciating my life and my friends, family even more.
