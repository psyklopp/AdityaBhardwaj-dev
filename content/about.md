 There are a lot of things that define me and have led me to where I am today. I am grateful for every experience I had.

 ## Going out of my city for bachelor's studies

 Helped me to see the world outside. Picked up both good and bad habits. Learned how to adjust and be like water. Learned how to learn. Got my first job as Java Developer in the German conglomorate Siemens. Blessed to have seen the corporate life

 ## Going out of country for master's studies

 It would be an understatement to say that this has been a **different** experience. Going out of India, and choosing Budapest for my MSc... was one of the best decisions. Of course, there were a lot of barriers as one might face when arriving overseas to another continent but they are stepping stones.

 Made good friends. Learned some Hungarian (still learning).

 I messed up in my 3rd semester of studies so have to extend for one year. But I plan to smash it in my last year. Making this website is one step towards it, to make myself accountable. I will go back to basics and learn. And not be lazy.

 ## DJ

 I have been learning to DJ on my little Pioneer DJ-200 console. Here is one mix from my YouTube channel.
