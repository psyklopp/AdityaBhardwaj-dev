The past few days gave me a hard reality check and most importantly, made me realize how people are the most important part of your life.</h2>
<hr>
<p>In my last post, I had shared that I was in the process of applying for the job-seeking visa. It turned out that the rules now are EXTREMELY strict regarding the timeline of application.</p>
<p>The staff in one of the office branches straight-up refused to accept my application. Even though I was late, I should have got the chance to submit it. I was not even given any document specifying the reason for turning me away.</p>
<p>Alternative? Find a job in a week.</p>
<p>Which was possible. But only mathematically.</p>
<p>I was distraught, not because I had go back to India but at the fact that after spending 3 years studying for a Master&rsquo;s degree, you are not given the chance to stay and use it.</p>
<p>It was on the last day when I was saved by a very helpful person. I went to a different branch of the immigration office and the guy attending my case, understood my situation immediately.</p>
<p>To say that he was helpful, would be an under-statement. He made calls to his supervisor including other officials to gather facts about my case. Honestly, I had no expectation but the official tried his best and accepted my application in the end.</p>
<p>Though this doesn&rsquo;t mean that I am granted the relevant visa, I just wanted a fair chance and I got it.</p>
<h2 id="very-bad-shoulder-pain">Very bad shoulder pain.</h2>
<p>I am pretty sure that it is due to my bad sleeping posture and the use of fan.</p>
<p>I went to have a massage and now I wonder why didn&rsquo;t I try it earlier. The lady was very sweet and I think she saw the relief I had, on my face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You a new man&rsquo;, she said. I was, indeed.</p>
<p>Will definitely go again.</p>
<h2 id="next">Next?</h2>
<p>Will prepare for what is coming next.</p>
<p>And now I know that I should be appreciating my life and my friends, family even more.</p>
