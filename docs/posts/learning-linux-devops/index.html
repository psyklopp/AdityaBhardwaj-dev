			<p>I also recently applied for a <strong>Product Support Intern</strong> position in Ericsson recently. It didn&rsquo;t ask for a lot of technical skills but it surely mentions that a good understanding of Linux, IP, Cloud technologies or Python is an <code>advantage</code>. Of course it is.</p>
<p>Keeping up and polishing the basics is the most important aspect of being a developer. The time when I was working in India as a Java developer, my manager often emphasized how crucial it is to be <em>VERY</em> good with the basics of the technology you are working on/with. Senior developers tend to get their skills rusty in this department&hellip; because they have other stuff to attend to.</p>
<p>Therefore I am gonna work on my basics now. Although I am studying cybersecurity, I want to get comfortable with Linux first.</p>
<p>I came across this page: <a href="https://nixstech.com/education/linux-administration-devops-course/">Linux Administration/DevOps Course</a> on Facebook. (It was a sponsored post) Probably the only time I clicked on an actual ad.</p>
<p>Never the less, I registered for it and received an email with links to a portal. I had to do some quizzes. It was actually a really nice experience and the questions were not witless or dull like I have experienced before. I will share about this later and update this post.</p>

<p>more coming soon</p>
