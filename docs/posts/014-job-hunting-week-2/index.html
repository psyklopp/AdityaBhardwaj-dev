			<p>I had my thesis defense on 28 June, Friday and I am happy to announce it was successful!</p>
<h1 id="01-july---monday">01 July - Monday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I will make a simple app containing cybersecurity news.</li>
<li>Yet to decide on the design scheme but have a general idea.</li>
<li>If I take a course from Udemy, should be enough to get me started towards what I want.</li>
<li>Should have no ads, no data collection, signup on a single website using QR code.</li>
<li>Simple design, easy to read single page, minimum obstruction to reading.</li>
<li>Advertisers can sponsor if the text is relevant.</li>
<li>Option to change text size.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="02-july---tuesday">02 July - Tuesday</h1>
<ul>
<li>Made a small list of resources like websites and blogs where I can see news.</li>
<li>Will be using RSS reader to fetch latest posts.</li>
<li>Created Google alerts for keywords related to cybersecurity.</li>
<li>Need to start learning development in Flutter.</li>
<li>And also plan to do some courses on the &lsquo;LinkedIn Learning&rsquo; platform.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a good collection of resources to start at the moment. Maybe I can start posting content on LinkedIn. Need to create a habit of creating content.</p>
<h1 id="03-july---wednesday">03 July - Wednesday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have started the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/">Flutter &amp; Dart - The Complete Guide</a></li>
<li>I had started this course even before but that was the time when I was busy with the admission process as well.</li>
<li>This time, I will finish it for sure.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="long-term-goals">Long-term goals</h2>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Create a web app. Invite only</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> People can choose their favorite story. Win a chance to get vouchers in cybersecurity.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Keep low barriers to trying your app.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Gamifying can help.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>This way I will make something for real. And will keep learning about cybersecurity too. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make something useful for people.</p>
