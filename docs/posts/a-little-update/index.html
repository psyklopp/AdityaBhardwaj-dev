			<p>Just wanted to come here and share that I have been quite busy these days. First, I am still waiting for Ericsson and SAP to respond to the internship application :/ I have also been trying to keep up with the college work. I chose &ldquo;Comparative study of post-quantum key-exchange mechanisms and its implementations&rdquo; for one of my labs. It will require me to make a report and a presentation on my findings.</p>
<p>Look like there is a lot of post-quantum for me in this semester. I have decided to do my thesis work&hellip; also based on lattice-based blind signatures, to be used in e-cash mechanism. It is interesting and I hope I will be able to do my best.</p>
<p>It will be a little hard but I guess, we just move through and keep up with the courseware. I will try to share some notes on the subjects I have on that particular day. Will help in accountability.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-learning-linuxdevops">What about learning Linux/DevOps</h2>
<p>Oooh. I did install Elementary OS which is a beautiful Linux distribution. And now that I think about it, I will start using a little bit more. Windows is of course, so comfortable to use and honestly, there has been some time since I shut it down and let it rest.</p>
<p>Phew.</p>
<p>Python is something I will be using a lot. So yep, it&rsquo;s definitely a good idea to start using Linux.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</h2>
<ul>
<li>Keep track of subjects</li>
<li>Plan the work for lab-course</li>
<li>Start using Elementary OS</li>
<li>One day at a time.</li>
</ul>
