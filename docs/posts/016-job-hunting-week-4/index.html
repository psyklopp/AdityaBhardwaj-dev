			<h2 id="this-week-is-a-little-different-as-i-will-be-outside-budapest-for-the-majority-of-the-week">This week is a little different as I will be outside Budapest for the majority of the week.</h2>
<hr>
<p>I was outside Budapest and came back today (Friday 19 July). I am still in the process of applying for a job-seeking visa. There was one important document for which I had to return early but eventually I was able to vist the office to get the same!</p>
<p>CTFs is something I had never tried before but they are very interesting and I want to continue doing it.</p>
<p>I am applying to various jobs and no one wants to give a chance, even for just an interview or a preliminary discussion. It&rsquo;s also time to redo my CV perhaps?</p>
<p>Currently I am also working on developing a Wordpress website. I have some experience with using Wordpress and this allows me to earn some much-needed-cash.</p>
<h2 id="heading">&hellip;
I am still hopeful to find a suitable job where I can learn more.
