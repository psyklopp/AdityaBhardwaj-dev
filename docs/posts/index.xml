      <description>Updated on 20 September
It has to be something.
It’s been so much time since I picked up a good technical skill or knowledge.
I hope this post doesn’t turn into a rant, but I am here to share what I plan to follow. There are so many paths, roadmaps, guides, or websites that one can follow. Classic case of information-overload. Happened to me as well, and me, being anxious and over-thinking, it hits hard.</description>

      <description>I had made this post on September 12 originally.
I was waiting for a reply from Instagram naively. After reading a bunch of articles, I can state it safely that it is highly improbable that someone will even look at it.
A longshot I will give a little bit of the backstory&amp;hellip; I had posted a story on Instagram that said I will make a few mixes titled SANTSAT killer. Here&amp;rsquo;s the screenshot of the story which I took.</description>

      <description>I also recently applied for a Product Support Intern position in Ericsson recently. It didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a lot of technical skills but it surely mentions that a good understanding of Linux, IP, Cloud technologies or Python is an advantage. Of course it is.
Keeping up and polishing the basics is the most important aspect of being a developer. The time when I was working in India as a Java developer, my manager often emphasized how crucial it is to be VERY good with the basics of the technology you are working on/with.</description>

      <description>I had used Jekyll or Hugo some time ago. So this time when I setup this website, I had a couple of issues. It would be safe to say that there are some tasks that we think, are going to be easy but then it takes more time than intended.
I am going to list the main points here so that it is easier for my future self too.
This little blogpost assumes that the DNS record is set up correctly for your custom domain.</description>
