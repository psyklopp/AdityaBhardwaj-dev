			<p>I had made this post on September 12 originally.</p>
<p>I was waiting for a reply from Instagram naively. After reading a bunch of articles, I can state it safely that it is highly improbable that someone will even look at it.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyklopp/AdityaBhardwaj-dev/main/images/3-insta-help.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>A longshot</h4>
    </figcaption>

<p>I will give a little bit of the backstory&hellip; I had posted a story on Instagram that said I will make a few mixes titled SANTSAT killer. Here&rsquo;s the screenshot of the story which I took.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psyklopp/AdityaBhardwaj-dev/main/images/3-insta-post-screenshot.png"><figcaption>
      <h4>OK. So that was a little rude</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The same evening of posting this, I was not able to see it anymore. Now I searched about it and it could have been that something was up with my phone itself. Low-speed internet connection perhaps. I made a new story and included it in the highlights. This way I know it&rsquo;s gonna be there in my account until and unless it is reported and Instagram removes it. But today, I was flummoxed when I was not able to view the same. Well, it just needed some time (and me closing the app) to load the story.</p>
<p>This is the reason I am confused about the story which disappeared from the account.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-i-actually-think">What do I actually think</h2>
<p>I asked my friend to visit my account and see the story but it was not visible on her account as well. Now I understand my internet connection might have been the issue but the same story cannot vanish from everywhere unless it was removed.</p>
<p>After rambling so much, I would just add my closing remarks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Instagram account of SANTSAT did see my story.</li>
<li>I couldn&rsquo;t see my story after 8 hours, let alone the 24h limit</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t believe it was my internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>So a festival got offended that an individual wrote something bad. I accept that it was a little cocky on my part but I would have liked them to take it in a friendly manner maybe and do something else (if they <strong>DID</strong> report the story). That&rsquo;s why I used the name <em>Sorry SANTSAT</em> this time üòé I intend to do 2-3 more mixes in that series. And I will definitely keep them in Instagram highlights.</p>
<p>And SANTSAT, if you came this far to read, I can use a job as a DJ. I have good music to share ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
