			<h2 id="i-will-start-the-newsletter-this-week-i-am-still-applying-for-jobs-but-its-so-hard-to-get-interviews-haha-still-at-it">I will start the newsletter this week. I am still applying for jobs but it&rsquo;s so hard to get interviews haha. Still at it.</h2>
<hr>
<h1 id="08-july---monday">08 July - Monday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have chosen the theme for the newsletter and I used Canva for this! They have a lot of templates.</li>
<li>I think it is better to give headlines or the title of the news rather than writing about one piece.</li>
<li>It will also allow me to gather more news in one place.</li>
<li>More things to come&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="09-july---tuesday">09 July - Tuesday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have to build a VM environment for learning Windows Server and another environment for Malware analysis.</li>
<li>Closed in more on the template to use for the newsletter. It&rsquo;s basic-simple and is dark-theme.</li>
<li>Have to write fresh content for Dezible. Maybe I should document my journey and share it on LinkedIn as well.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="10-july---wednesday">10 July - Wednesday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was able to install Windows Server 2022 and Windows 10 Enterprise on VirtualBox successfully.</li>
<li>Made the header for the newsletter. Now will test by adding some text.</li>
<li>But there is a lot of personal work left at the moment - Administration stuff for Visa. Phew.</li>
<li>Started maintaining a spreadsheet for my daily work and keeping track of resources I use.</li>
<li>Better to follow the course on malware analysis by TCM - can move to advanced course after that.</li>
<li>Will focus on Malware, Breaches and Vulnerabilities in the newsletter - with reports/findings at the side.</li>
<li>Should also start CTFs - I found a good site</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="11-july---thursday">11 July - Thursday</h1>
<ul>
<li>I would call it a productive day. I was able to get my personal shit done.</li>
<li>There are a couple more things to take care of.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="12-july---friday">12 July - Friday</h1>
<ul>
<li>Looks like I am nearly done with the documentation required for the Visa thingy.</li>
<li>But it was very hot and I didn&rsquo;t feel like doing anything.</li>
<li>A little sad because, though I have things-to-do already planned, takes more than just time to get on them and finish them.</li>
<li>Should not aim for perfection. Should start writing right away.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading">&hellip;
It will be a better week ahead for sure.
