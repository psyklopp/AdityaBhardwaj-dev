      <description>Updated on 20 September&#xA;It has to be something.&#xA;It’s been so much time since I picked up a good technical skill or knowledge.&#xA;I hope this post doesn’t turn into a rant, but I am here to share what I plan to follow. There are so many paths, roadmaps, guides, or websites that one can follow. Classic case of information-overload. Happened to me as well, and me, being anxious and over-thinking, it hits hard.</description>

      <description>I also recently applied for a Product Support Intern position in Ericsson recently. It didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for a lot of technical skills but it surely mentions that a good understanding of Linux, IP, Cloud technologies or Python is an advantage. Of course it is.&#xA;Keeping up and polishing the basics is the most important aspect of being a developer. The time when I was working in India as a Java developer, my manager often emphasized how crucial it is to be VERY good with the basics of the technology you are working on/with.</description>
