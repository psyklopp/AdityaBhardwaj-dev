      <description>Presentations, reading reports and preparing documents is something that I have always found interesting. I believe that cybersecurity is too technical sometimes.&#xA;Of course it is technical. But sometimes, all I need is a brief overview of a problem/solution in cybersecurity. There is a lot of academic research that goes on in the background. And it is not VERY common for people to go over such research regularly. And there is a lot of published data and reports that covers new technologies.</description>
