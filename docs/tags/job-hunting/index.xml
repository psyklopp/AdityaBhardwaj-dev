      <description>It is 7:44 P.M. at the time of writing.&#xA;I had a long day working on the presentation for my thesis. I added content on Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Shortest Integer Solution (SIS) which are important concepts in lattice-based cryptography. Though I am sure I added the important parts I will also refer to these notes for a better understanding.&#xA;The next thing to do is to add the ROS attack.</description>
