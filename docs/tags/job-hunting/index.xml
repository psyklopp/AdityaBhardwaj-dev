      <description>This is the week where I have my thesis defense. And then I can finally say that I completed my Master&amp;rsquo;s degree!&#xA;24 June - Monday I just finished writing notes for OSI Model and will share them soon in my website Dezible. I think this was the first time when I actually liked learning (and not just cramming) about OSI layer. 25 June - Tuesday It was a fun night as my friend was leaving back to India.</description>

      <description>One of my old-childhood friend came to Budapest to visit me and the city. It was really nice as we went to the Coldplay concert and even went to thermal bath. Though I enjoyed a lot, I was not able to devote much time to job hunting. I have received a warm response from one of the jobs I applied to and I am really hoping to hear positive news.</description>

      <description>I have been focusing more on the job hunting process now. Although I still have my thesis defense to prepare, would it even matter even if I ace it?&#xA;Although I would feel very happy to conclude my studies but as an immigrant, you have to think about the next (two)steps at any given point of time.&#xA;I have applied to a total of 4 jobs up until now. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where that goes.</description>

      <description>It is 7:44 P.M. at the time of writing.&#xA;I had a long day working on the presentation for my thesis. I added content on Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) and Shortest Integer Solution (SIS) which are important concepts in lattice-based cryptography. Though I am sure I added the important parts I will also refer to these notes for a better understanding.&#xA;The next thing to do is to add the ROS attack.</description>
