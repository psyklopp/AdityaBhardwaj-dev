      <description>In my last post I mentioned that I will try going to a café perhaps, to study and increase my working hours. Well it worked!&#xA;I was able to finish my thesis just because I went out to an environment which was not super comfortable. In my case, it was McDonald&amp;rsquo;s. Yep, I was going out everyday, buying a coffee and sitting for 3-4 hours. Super productive&#xA;End of studies I was able to finish my thesis on time and now I am preparing for the thesis defense.</description>

      <description>Now that the date is getting closer I feel more anxious. But I have been trying to keep it in under check.&#xA;Going outside, like to a cafe It gets a little harder when you have to sit down, in your room and focus on your work. I am not sure what&amp;rsquo;s the exact reason but I guess it&amp;rsquo;s more comfortable at home and you have a lot of stuff that you can get distracted by.</description>

      <title>Journaling and Thesis</title>

      <description>I am more focused on my thesis than ever. So it is very common to lose the train of thought and spiral down into side-quests (which are not important at the moment)&#xA;Writing helps Because my brain is just working and thinking about so many things at the same time, writing them down narrows the big tunnel of thoughts. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like meditating, but actively choosing to think about one topic at particular at a time.</description>

      <description>Happy Easter!&#xA;It is actually a surprise (to me) that I am watching tutorials and started learning about Linux (because I want to know more about DevOps and maybe have a job). TCM Security has a Linux 101 course which I am following at the moment. I also made a couple of notes which I will share here. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice and should continue to do it.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to come here and share that I have been quite busy these days. First, I am still waiting for Ericsson and SAP to respond to the internship application :/ I have also been trying to keep up with the college work. I chose &amp;ldquo;Comparative study of post-quantum key-exchange mechanisms and its implementations&amp;rdquo; for one of my labs. It will require me to make a report and a presentation on my findings.</description>

      <description>Updated on 20 September&#xA;It has to be something.&#xA;It’s been so much time since I picked up a good technical skill or knowledge.&#xA;I hope this post doesn’t turn into a rant, but I am here to share what I plan to follow. There are so many paths, roadmaps, guides, or websites that one can follow. Classic case of information-overload. Happened to me as well, and me, being anxious and over-thinking, it hits hard.</description>

      <title>The curious case of my missing Instagram story</title>

      <description>I had made this post on September 12 originally.&#xA;I was waiting for a reply from Instagram naively. After reading a bunch of articles, I can state it safely that it is highly improbable that someone will even look at it.&#xA;A longshot I will give a little bit of the backstory&amp;hellip; I had posted a story on Instagram that said I will make a few mixes titled SANTSAT killer. Here&amp;rsquo;s the screenshot of the story which I took.</description>
