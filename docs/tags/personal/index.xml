      <description>Happy Easter!
It is actually a surprise (to me) that I am watching tutorials and started learning about Linux (because I want to know more about DevOps and maybe have a job). TCM Security has a Linux 101 course which I am following at the moment. I also made a couple of notes which I will share here. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice and should continue to do it.</description>

      <description>Just wanted to come here and share that I have been quite busy these days. First, I am still waiting for Ericsson and SAP to respond to the internship application :/ I have also been trying to keep up with the college work. I chose &amp;ldquo;Comparative study of post-quantum key-exchange mechanisms and its implementations&amp;rdquo; for one of my labs. It will require me to make a report and a presentation on my findings.</description>

      <description>Updated on 20 September
It has to be something.
It’s been so much time since I picked up a good technical skill or knowledge.
I hope this post doesn’t turn into a rant, but I am here to share what I plan to follow. There are so many paths, roadmaps, guides, or websites that one can follow. Classic case of information-overload. Happened to me as well, and me, being anxious and over-thinking, it hits hard.</description>

      <description>I had made this post on September 12 originally.
I was waiting for a reply from Instagram naively. After reading a bunch of articles, I can state it safely that it is highly improbable that someone will even look at it.
A longshot I will give a little bit of the backstory&amp;hellip; I had posted a story on Instagram that said I will make a few mixes titled SANTSAT killer. Here&amp;rsquo;s the screenshot of the story which I took.</description>
